I invite everyone to create their own [branch](https://github.com/blog/1377-create-and-delete-branches) of this repository, editing this file, and submitting a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

The reason we should probably be doing that instead of pushing our commits directly to master is so we can make sure everything gets glued together correctly.

More info about repositories [here](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/)

This is non-essential, but if you happen to be confused [this](https://git-scm.com/documentation) may help. It explains what git is and how it works.

hope this helps
